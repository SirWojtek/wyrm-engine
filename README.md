wyrm-engine is fully typed game engine library which is designed to simulate battles between in-game characters.
The main goal of wyrm-engine is to abstract the battle logic from the rest of the game, which makes it usable
for wide pick of virtual worlds, from fantasy to sci-fi. To achieve that, wyrm-engine is using generic parameters
to define sites of battle with keeping the usage as simple as possible.

wyrm-engine main features:
* fully-typed, fully-written in Typescript,
* lightweight,
* simple in use,
* customizable engine parameters.
